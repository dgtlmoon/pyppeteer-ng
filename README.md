pyppeteer-ng
==========

This is an experimental fork of https://github.com/pyppeteer/pyppeteer , but with a little more salt and pepper to support https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io.

This is based on pyppeteer [![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pyppeteer.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyppeteer) **`master` with `dev` branch merged**


## Installation

pyppeteer requires Python >= 3.8

Install with `pip` from PyPI:

```
pip install pyppeteer-ng
```

And then continue exactly the same way as https://github.com/pyppeteer/pyppeteer?tab=readme-ov-file#examples
